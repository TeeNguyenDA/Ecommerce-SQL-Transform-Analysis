# Final SQL Project: Transforming and Analyzing Data Using Postgresql

## Project/Goals

This ecommerce dataset is probably a demo database from the Google Merchandise Store, with millions of Google Analytics records in the ‘Analytics’ table (over 4M rows). By using a copy of that dataset, we are trying to achieve those goals:

- Access an ecommerce dataset from csv file
- Investigate and perform data cleaning and transformation: Remove irrelevant, duplicated data, Fix structural errors, Do type conversion, Handle missing, Fill in missing data if any
- Look at the dataset metadata, analyze and recommend (if any) relations between the tables and columns and constraints
- Understand ecommerce and Google Analytics metrics
-  Write and execute queries to answer business questions
- Perform the QA process for data cleaning

Given 5 separate datasets (`all_sessions`, `analytics`, `products`, `sales_by_sku`, `sales_report`), our goal is to create a new PostgreSQL database called `ecommerce` by setting up tables and importing data into the tables for each .csv file. Then, we will perform data cleaning and transformation on the `ecommerce` database prior to answering any possible business problems in the dataset.

## Process

### 1. Import and clean the database

### 2. Clean and transform the data: 

- In the following sequence of the tables: `all_sessions`, `analytics`, `products`, `sales_by_sku`, `sales_report`
- Cleaning with business in mind!
- The overall approach to clean the data across the 5 tables in the ecommerce database, table by table:
-- Remove irrelevant, duplicated data (full / partial duplicate)
-- Fix structural errors
-- Do type conversion
-- Handle missing 
-- Fill in missing data if any
  
### 3. Starting with questions

- Answer a given set of questions to provide queries and explanations

### 4. Starting with data

- Self-construct a set of questions related to the data, provide queries and explanations

### 5. Create the ERD schema using Postgresql

### 6. Describe the QA process with queries and explanations
