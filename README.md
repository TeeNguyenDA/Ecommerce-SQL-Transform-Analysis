# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals

This ecommerce dataset is probably a demo database from the Google Merchandise Store, with millions of Google Analytics records in the ‘Analytics’ table (over 4M rows). By using a copy of that dataset, we are trying to achieve those goals:

- Access an ecommerce dataset from csv file
- Investigate and perform data cleaning and transformation: Remove irrelevant, duplicated data, Fix structural errors, Do type conversion, Handle missing, Fill in missing data if any
- Look at the dataset metadata, analyze and recommend (if any) relations between the tables and columns and constraints
- Understand ecommerce and Google Analytics metrics
-  Write and execute queries to answer business questions
- Perform the QA process for data cleaning

Given 5 separate datasets (`all_sessions`, `analytics`, `products`, `sales_by_sku`, `sales_report`), our goal is to create a new PostgreSQL database called `ecommerce` by setting up tables and importing data into the tables for each .csv file. Then, we will perform data cleaning and transformation on the `ecommerce` database prior to answering any possible business problems in the dataset.

## Process
### 1. Understand the data
### 2. Clean and transform the data: 
- In the following sequence of the tables: `all_sessions`, `analytics`, `products`, `sales_by_sku`, `sales_report`
### 3. Answer questions and reflect on further business questions that may arise
### 4. Construct the QA process
